Hello !

Welcome to Wordly, a project that aims to provide tools for world builders !

Wordly started on June 2024 as a personal project to help me with my own world building.
I just didn't find any tool that was fitting my needs, so I decided to create my own.

I wanted something that wasn't too overwhelming, but that still provided a lot of features,
all that for free. I wasn't planning to make a lot of efforts for people to contribute to it,
but more and more people thought the project was interesting, and someone even wanted to help.

The project was technically open source on github but it didn't even had a license or a correct README.
When I went to the 'Capitol du libre', a free software event, I went to a conference about
how to manage an open source project, and I decided to apply what I learned to Wordly.

I don't expect people to be interested in helping right away, nor at all, but I at least hope
some people will find the project useful for themself.

For now it's still in early development and unuseable, but it will grow with time, so stay tuned !

Thank you for reading, and have a nice day !
